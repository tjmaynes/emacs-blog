\begin{itemize}
\item Pair programmed and test-drove a Clojure-based microservice that automated the manual input of metadata across thousands of programs which resulted in saving our business unit millions of dollars. The service was deployed on AWS ECS and used AWS RDS and Elasticsearch services.
\item Test-drove a ReactJS-based website to enable Spanish and English-speaking World Cup viewers to watch authenticated World Cup games on Telemundo which resulted in millions of these users being informed with ways to watch the final series of World Cup games. The website was built using server-side rendering via an ExpressJS backend and deployed on AWS ECS.
\item Pair programmed and test-drove an Elixir-based Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) service for our iOS team which resulted in more feature development, faster release cycles and a simpler iOS architecture. The service was deployed on AWS ECS and used AWS RDS and API Gateway.
\item Other backend services that we implemented and managed used microservices patterns and Continuous Deployment practices, including setting up automated tests and pipelines for deploying our microservices to AWS ECS using custom tools built in-house.
