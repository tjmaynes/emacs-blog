#+TITLE: Blogging with Org-mode
#+DATE: <2019-12-16, Mon>
#+DESCRIPTION: In this blog post, I'll be discussing how to use org-publish to convert blog posts written in org-mode to styled HTML pages.

I recently replaced my jekyll-based blog with an org-mode based blog. Getting started with this was a little daunting at first, but I was able to find some blog posts. I just wanted to discuss one part of the experience that was difficult to get documentation for.
